For JSON File export we can probably just take the API-return of the function which gets all elements
For import we either need to find a way to loop through a list and add the elements through the existing addcontact function or we need to purpose build a complete function
idea 1:
PutJson()
{
	listFromJsonFile = read(whatever.JSON);
	lenght = howManyElements(listFromJsonFile);
	while(i <= length, i++)
	{
		contactToBeAdded = getLastEntry(listFromJsonFile);
		AddContact(contactToBeAdded);
		deleteLastEntry(listFromJsonFile);
	}
	return "all done";
}

idea 2:
this would be the same concept as above, but with a AddContact function which does not return a message (might print a "added contact" message for every entry)

idea 3:
there might also be a function which just adds a list to a sql database

(solved) now working on a query to convert JSON into A SQLTable, having some problems, basically getting either an error message or an empty table
above has been mitigated, still working on making the query
