For JSON File export we can probably just take the API-return of the function which gets all elements
For import we either need to find a way to loop through a list and add the elements through the existing addcontact function or we need to purpose build a complete function
idea 1:
PutJson()
{
	listFromJsonFile = read(whatever.JSON);
	lenght = howManyElements(listFromJsonFile);
	while(i <= length, i++)
	{
		contactToBeAdded = getLastEntry(listFromJsonFile);
		AddContact(contactToBeAdded);
		deleteLastEntry(listFromJsonFile);
	}
	return "all done";
}

idea 2:
this would be the same concept as above, but with a AddContact function which does not return a message (might print a "added contact" message for every entry)

idea 3:
there might also be a function which just adds a list to a sql database

(solved) now working on a query to convert JSON into A SQLTable, having some problems, basically getting either an error message or an empty table
above has been mitigated, still working on making the query

almost done

!!!!
change telnr and hausnr to string make own commit
(done)

next creating a new table to have the tel.nr. in, since one person can and/or will have more than one number
the Tel.Nr. table stores a PersonId which corresponds to the given Id in the Person Table
have to remove the Telefonnummer comlumn from people which likely needs me to remove it from the peolple class, since it seems like that's where sql is taking the columns from
so either a struct in person class or, which is more likely, a telefonnummer class
having to modify the adding and updating functions to go into the telnr table and make an entry or update data there
	considering if adding these numbers should be a seperate api call, basically having the frontend submit all the other data first and then submitting tel numbers one by one
	this may require some hacky calls
		addContac(allDataButTelNr) -> wait for database to do its thing -> addTelNr(listOfTelNr, PersonId) -> show addedSuccess if both operations were completed
		repeat this for updateOverwrite
		if updateMerge, call addTelNr(singleTel, PersonId)
		how to edit a certain TelNr, need to have an id for that, how to put id for that into person table
	need the people table to be able to point at telNr and telNr table to point at person table
		hau
	for update i can bulid updateTelNr(oldTelNr, newTelNr, PersonId)
	we should consider having limit on how many phone numbers a single contact can have, for example if we have 4 max, we might be able to have sql assign ids for data under a certain personI

Experimenting with TelNrId as a way to pass vaiables into functions, doesn't work that well
	have to find out how to take passed in tel numbers, since they should be saved to a seperate table than the rest, but the frontend obviously won't pass two db tables through the api
	maybe have it pass the tel. number as a seperate string and the person object without telId filled in
		this would also require me to build getTelNr (which i have to do anyways i guess)

My idea is now to have the people table have a column for TelId instead of Telefonnummer and have the TelNr table have PersonId, which should then be pointing at each other
	upon investigating on this idea it seems not impossible but normally i should make a third table, though i may be able to get around this

FirstOrDefaultAsync returns an object

For some reason the database migration did not create the Personnummer column in the people table, or it is just not visible to me, also returns null and is visible through api with getAll
	i am assuming the table did actually not get the column and it returns null since the function knows person has Personnummer as a property, but no data = null
	first theory was sql not allowing for tables to point at each other, but i have not found anything which implicitly states this
	current guess is the List<Telefonnummer> is probably not quiet correct, since i only want Telefonnummer.Id in that list but List<Telefonnummer.Id> does not work
		at this point i'm somewhat convinced this is the case, though i don't know how to rebuild this yet
		maybe having List<int> and then after add-migration, write the foreign key into the migration manually (i haven't actually checked if a table can take a list of anything)
		i may have to build a third table, though that wouldn't help with the problem i'm having
	the column might just not be shown, but still exist? i will try out if it just works
		i might have been massively overthinking and wasting time for a while since i was mostly looking for a way to make my updatetelefonnummer function work
		but i can just pass the personId, old number and new number and go with that, i don't actually need a cell in people with all the telIds

The Personnummern list stays empty and doesn't get displayed in the table, i don't care about the displaying but it needs to be readable for at least the program + actually output
	it does show in the preview of the api in swagger ui
	at this point i'm assuming i have to somehow seed the data?

When inputting a new person with a phone number it correctly assigns personId and Id in the TelNr table
	tried using "return await appDbContext.People.Include("TelNr").ToListAsync();" but the query does not understand what or where TelNr is 
	"Unable to find navigation 'TelNr' specified in string based include path 'TelNr'."
	dbcontext.telnr also doesn't work
	i cannot get the include to work properly, will ask chris about it tomorrow, might be something wrong at a different part of the programm and i'm not seeing it

get all persons now properly works, i had to include PersonNummern as the related data table, i don't quiet understand why it works but it does, which is good i suppose

tested everything i could think of, API now has to be connected to frontend, have to wait on that one, since that is nours work and i don't quiet comprehend it
	also have to merge into the main branch and see if the process will destroy anything (data structure changed shortly after i created my branch)
	ask why Interface, why can't API direcly grab functions out of PersonService? also ask how the include for dbase functions works (i think i now why it works but i am not sure)(line 51  PersonService.cs)
